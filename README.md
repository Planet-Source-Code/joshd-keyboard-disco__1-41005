## Keyboard Disco


</div>

### Description

I downloaded the Disoco Keyboard a few days ago from A.K.San and did a little work on it. The form code is completely rewritten - but the base functions in the modules are all A.K.San's not mine.

I added a "editor" of sorts that lets you create save and load patterns very easily. I was considering making this able to minimize to the system tray. Any thoughts, sugesstions, whatever are welcome.

Instructions: Green=On, White=Off. Select a column by clicking beneth the circles pressing "Insert" will place a row before the current one and "Delete" will delete the selected row.
